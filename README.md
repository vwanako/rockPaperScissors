# rockPaperScissors

This project is a simple rock, paper, scissors game written in C++.

HOW IT WORKS:
  - First, we use "srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(time(0)));" to seed the random number that will be generated by the computer.
  - A string type vector *moves[3]* is created. We will use it to easily associate the computer's and user's moves with a specific element of the vector through indexes.
  - After receiving user input and checking if it's valid, the integer variable userChoice will be subtracted by one to get the correct index.
  - The program will then print the moves played.
  - We'll then use if else statements to check the win conditions. If both moves are equal, it's a tie. If not, we'll use a *beats* function, a boolean type function that returns TRUE if the first parameter (the user's move)
  beats the second parameter (the computer's move) and print "User wins!". If the function returns false, the computer wins.
